<ul>
<li>Our portal-Cliniro (Clinic-hero) is to create a common gateway for doctors as well as patients and improvise the manual and traditional clinic management system.</li>

<li>Cliniro is a Web-based portal that is designed to digitize every process in a clinic.</li>

<li>The doctor can save data of his patients, events, and appointments scheduling. Moreover, the patient can sign up, save and view their prescriptions and appointments from various doctors in a single place.</li>

<li>Cliniro will provide a dashboard that will show data visualizations giving insights into his clinic data.</li>

<li>This portal will have three sections- Doctor, Patient, and Assistant</li>
</ul>
